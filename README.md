# Hedera Smart Contracts Workshop tutorial repo

Smart contracts are a means to enable custom logic and processing in a DLT. Developers can harness their power to build their own decentralised applications (DApps). Learn how to get started with the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) in this workshop. You will learn Solidity syntax, and how to compile, deploy, and interact with your smart contracts on the Hedera network.

## Usage

Use `git` to clone this repo, then install dependencies using `npm`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hedera-dev/hedera-smart-contracts-workshop.git
cd hedera-smart-contracts-workshop
npm install

```

## Technologies

You will need NodeJs and npm in order to run this project.

This project was developed in Javascript and Solidity.
This project uses EthersJs, Hedera SDK JS,
the Solidity compiler (`solc`), and Hardhat.

## Configuration

This project requires several environment variables in order to work,
and they are expected to be set in the `.env` file in the root directory of this repo.

The *Intro* section of this tutorial,
specifically the *Configuration* section,
covers how to obtain and set the required environment variables.

## Tutorial

This repo is intended to be used alongside the tutorial:

[`github.com/bguiz/hedera-docs/tree/docs/hscs-tutorial-2/tutorials/smart-contracts/hscs-workshop`](https://github.com/bguiz/hedera-docs/tree/docs/hscs-tutorial-2/tutorials/smart-contracts/hscs-workshop) (WIP)

This was run (live) at the following events:
- 2023/07: DLT Science Foundation's [Oracle Hacks](https://oraclehacks.hackerearth.com/) hackathon.

To follow along, start with the `main` branch,
which is the *default branch* of this repo.
This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along
with the steps as described in the tutorial.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hedera-dev/hedera-smart-contracts-workshop.git
```

To skip ahead to the final state, use the `completed` branch.
This gives you the final state with which you can compare your implementation
to the completed steps of the tutorial.

```shell
git fetch origin completed:completed
git checkout completed
```

To see the full set of differences between
the initial and final states of the repo,
you can use `diff`.

```shell
git diff main..completed
```

Alternatively, you may view the diff rendered on Github:
[`hedera-dev/hedera-smart-contracts-workshop/compare/main..completed`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-smart-contracts-workshop/compare/main..completed)

Note that the branch names are delimited by `..`, and not by `...`,
as the latter finds the diff with the latest common ancestor commit,
which *is not* what we want in this case.

## Contributing

How to contribute to this project:

- Create a fork of this repo on github
- Clone that forked copy using github
- Make your changes on a new branch
- Commit those changes, and push them against a branch in *your forked copy* of the git repo
- Submit a PR against the `completed` branch of *this copy* of the git repo

This will modify the *final state* of the repo,
in other words, what someone should obtain *after*
they have followed along with all of the steps in the tutorial.

If you would like to modify the *initial state* of the repo as well,
perform the same steps as above,
but this time submit the PR against the `main` branch of *this copy* of the git repo.
This is what someone should obtain *before*
they follow along the first step in the tutorial.
